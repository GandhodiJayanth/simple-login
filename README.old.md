Creating Simple login page with Jest Test cases

# Using Jest Lib for Testing (https://testing-library.com/docs/)
# expect list (https://jestjs.io/docs/expect)
<ul>
<li>We want to test all the renderings on the browser(what ever the changes that user can see on the browser) test all those changes</li>
<li>this library offers a DOM testing lib we have an access to the dom elements and based on that we find dom elements on the page we can test them</li>
<li>Jest DOM is a Test runner when ever we fire npm test it will go and search for all the files which are accossiated with test.js</li>
<h3>Avoid Things in Testing</h3>
<li>when we are using React Test lib we need to avoid testing implementation logic (interanal method) Only need to test DOM elements</li>
<li>If we want to test the logic can go with enzyme(https://blog.logrocket.com/react-testing-library-vs-enzyme/)</li>
</ul>
